Basic azure resources creation using bash

Just clone the repo and execute the required resources script in Azure authenticated environment

resourceGroupCreation.sh - This script is used to create resource group

vnetCreation.sh - This script is used to create vnet - as of now it doesnot have any validations on address prefix and it doesn't take multiple address prefixes - hence please provide the input accordingly - will update the code soon.
